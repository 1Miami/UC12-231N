        <p style="font-size: 35px;">The Scream is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893.<br>
            The Norwegian name of the piece is Skrik (Scream), and the German title under which <br>
             it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature). The agonized <br>
              face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images in art, seen as <br> 
              symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch's work, including The Scream, <br>
               had a formative influence on the Expressionist movement.[1]</p>
